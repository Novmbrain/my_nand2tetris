Nand 2 Tetris is a computer science course that teaches you how to build a modern computer system from scratch. The course is divided into two parts:

- Building a computer hardware platform from basic logic gates, and
- Writing a compiler and operating system to run on the platform.

The course is project-based and hands-on, and it covers a wide range of topics in computer science, including Boolean algera, digital logic, computer architecture, assembly language programming, and software engineering.

The course is taught using a bottom-up approach, starting with the basic building blocks of the computer system and gradually building up to more complex components. The projects in the course are designed to be challenging but achievable, and they provide a good balance between theory and practice.

Overall, Nand 2 Tetris is an excellent course for anyone who is interested in learning about computer science and building a modern computer system from scratch. It is challenging, rewarding, and a lot of fun.
